# CalTech101-Image-Classification-Model
I created an Image Classification model based on the CalTech 101 Image dataset using the fastai library. It was trained with over 9000 images that related to 101 categories and was able to predict the category of the image with 94% accuracy.

This is the reference to the dataset I used for this model.
